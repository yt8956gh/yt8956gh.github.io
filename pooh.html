    <div class="heading">Pooh's Appearance</div>
    Pooh is an anthropomorphic teddy bear. He is short, has yellow fur, and a round belly. He has black dot eyes, a
    black nose, a short snout, and small round ears. There is also stitching on his belly and bottom, which occasionally
    rips open. He only wears a small red short-sleeved shirt, in which his belly hangs out of.

    <div class="heading">Personality</div>
    Pooh Bear resides in the Hundred Acre Wood, an imaginative world inhabited by anthropomorphic stuffed toys and
    animals that Christopher Robin frequents. Pooh is stuffed with fluff, and therefor impervious to pain. Due to his
    obesity, his seams burst open on occasion, but Pooh has become so accustomed to this that he can tie it back
    together in seconds. Pooh's tree house—which is under the name Sanders—is mostly filled with jars and jars of honey,
    which he harvests from bee hives throughout the day.

    <div class="heading">Origin</div>
    "Winnie-the-Pooh," as he was originally called, first appeared in a story written by A.A. Milne, who based the
    characters off his young owner Christopher Robin Milne and the boy's stuffed animals. The original toy bear was
    named after Winnie (short for "Winnipeg"), a bear that had been adopted as a cub by a Canadian soldier during World
    War I, who was a popular attraction at the London Zoo. The stories were popular in the Disney household, motivating
    Walt to start production on a series of featurettes starring the honey-obsessed bear and his collection of friends.
